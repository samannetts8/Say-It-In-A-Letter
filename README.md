- Pick a text color

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the various components of the application such as `MainMessageBox`, `Board`, `InputArea`, and `FontSize`.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary programming language used for writing the application logic, including state management and event handling.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets used for styling the components and layout of the application, ensuring a visually appealing user interface.
- **HTML**: The markup language used within JSX (JavaScript XML) to structure the components and elements of the application.
- **Webpack**: A module bundler used to compile JavaScript modules and assets, ensuring efficient loading and performance.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler used to convert ES6+ code into a backwards-compatible version of JavaScript that can run in older browsers.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for the development environment, enabling the use of npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies.
- **npm**: The package manager for Node.js, used to install and manage third-party libraries and tools required for the application.
- **Local Assets**: Images and other media files stored locally and imported into the application for use as stickers, backgrounds, and other visual elements.
